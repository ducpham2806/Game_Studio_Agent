description: Game QA lead, automated test architect, bug triage, and playtest analyst based on Claude-Code-Game-Studios 1.3 (/qa-plan, /smoke-check, /soak-test, /regression-suite, /test-setup, /test-evidence-review, /bug-report, /bug-triage, /playtest-report). Enforces visual runtime verification with stamped evidence, the one-shot small check for browser games, automated unit/integration test harnesses, and structured bug/playtest reporting. Use when creating QA test plans, setting up game test suites, checking a one-shot build, triaging bugs, analyzing playtest sessions, or verifying visual/gameplay stories before closure. Not for engine-specific headless runners (godot-gdscript-headless-testing) or frame-time work (performance-optimization).

# Game QA & Playtest

QA Lead and Verification Engineer skill responsible for test planning, automated test suites (unit, integration, soak, regression), runtime visual evidence verification, bug triage, and playtest telemetry analysis.

## When to Use

- Designing a QA test plan or setting up an automated test runner (`/qa-plan`, `/test-setup`, `/test-helpers`)
- Running smoke checks, long-duration soak tests, or regression suites (`/smoke-check`, `/soak-test`, `/regression-suite`, `/test-flakiness`)
- Reviewing story test evidence before closing a story (`/test-evidence-review`)
- Filing reproducible bug reports or triaging bug backlogs by severity (`/bug-report`, `/bug-triage`); `/bug-report` drafts only and never files upstream
- Conducting structured playtest sessions and synthesizing player feedback (`/playtest-report`)

## Steps

### 1. Configure Test Harness & QA Plan (`/qa-plan` & `/test-setup`)

Structure `tests/` into four clear verification tiers matched to the project's engine (GUT/GdUnit4 for Godot 4, Unity Test Framework for Unity, Automation System for Unreal):

1. **Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)**: Pure logic tests for damage formulas, economy curves, inventory math, and state machine transitions (fast, headless, deterministic).
2. **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)**: Multi-system interactions (for example, weapon hitbox collides with enemy hurtbox -> health decreases -> death signal fires -> loot drops -> UI updates).
3. **Data & Config Validation (`tests/config/`)**: Automated schema checks ensuring every JSON/Resource file under `<assets_root>/data/` parses cleanly, has no missing asset paths, and stays within valid min/max bounds.
4. **Performance & Soak Tests (`tests/soak/`)**: Automated stress loops (spawning 500 entities, rapid scene transitions for 30+ minutes) checking for memory leaks, orphaned nodes, or FPS degradation.

### 2. Enforce Runtime Visual Verification (`/test-evidence-review`)

A passing headless test never proves that a menu is on-screen or a sprite animation aligns properly:

1. **The Look Rule**: Any change affecting player-visible visuals, UI layout, shaders, camera, or animation requires launching the game/scene and capturing runtime visual evidence in `production/qa/evidence/`.
2. **Evidence Audit**: Verify that each story's required test categories (`logic`, `integration`, `visual`, `UI`, `config`) have corresponding passing outputs or screenshots before approving `/story-done`.
3. **Evidence Stamps**: Each story's retained screenshots sit beside a `stamp.txt` that lists the files they prove. `/test-evidence-review` names every listed file changed since ("re-capture it") or says "no stamp" for older evidence; it reports, never blocks.
4. **One-shot Small Check (browser games)**: About five minutes in a headless browser: open with no console errors, a few scripted key presses that show it responds, one screenshot of play looked at against `design/game-brief.md`, and four rows (boots, responds, keeps the user's words, every figure drawn with no emoji). Fix text that is too small, overlapping or off screen and frozen screens in one round; list the rest as still broken. The first build writes no robot player and never tunes difficulty by script: the user's play is the balance check, and the handover says "Not yet played by a person".

### 3. Run Smoke Checks & Regression Suites (`/smoke-check` & `/regression-suite`)

Before any milestone build or branch merge, execute the 5-minute Smoke Check checklist:

- Game boots to Main Menu with zero console errors or missing resource warnings.
- New Game / Load Game transitions cleanly into the playable level.
- Core player controls (move, action, pause menu) respond as expected.
- Save/Load cycle preserves core state without corruption.
- Clean exit without crashes or leaked RIDs/objects.

### 4. Structured Bug Reporting & Triage (`/bug-report` & `/bug-triage`)

Document defects in `production/qa/bugs/BUG-XXX-<slug>.md` and prioritize them objectively:

- **Severity Matrix**:
  - **S0 - Blocker / Crash**: Game crashes, soft-locks, corrupts saves, or prevents build compilation. Must fix immediately.
  - **S1 - Critical**: Core gameplay loop broken, major balance exploit, or unreadable UI on target resolution.
  - **S2 - Major**: Noticeable mechanic bug with a workaround, moderate visual glitch, or frame drop below target.
  - **S3 - Minor / Polish**: Cosmetic alignment issue, typo, or minor audio pop.
- **Required Bug Fields**: Environment/Engine version, Commit SHA, Exact Reproduction Steps (1, 2, 3), Expected Result, Actual Result, Console Logs/Stack Trace, and Visual Evidence.

### 5. Synthesize Playtest Reports (`/playtest-report`)

Analyze playtest observations using objective behavioral signals alongside player quotes:

1. **Separate Observation from Prescription**: When players say "this boss is unfair and needs 50% less HP", diagnose the root cause first (for example, telegraphs are only 150 ms or obscured by particle VFX).
2. **Track Funnel & Friction Metrics**: Record time-to-first-action, tutorial completion rate, death hotspots, and UI confusion points, then map actionable recommendations back to specific GDD sections.

## Gotchas

- Never accept a syntax check (`gdscript --check` or compilation pass) as substitute evidence for a visual or gameplay story.
- Eliminate flaky tests (`/test-flakiness`) caused by unseeded `randf()` calls or frame-timing race conditions by injecting deterministic RNG seeds and awaiting explicit signals in tests.
- A bug in an engine, plugin or vendor tool is written up as a draft for the user to submit; no agent opens or comments on an upstream issue or pull request, even when asked.
- A browser check that cannot start (no headless Chromium, sandbox refused the socket) is reported as NOT ASSESSED with the reason, never as passed.
